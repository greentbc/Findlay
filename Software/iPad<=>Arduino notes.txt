Questions:
	What is the latency from iPad sending command to robot acting on it?
	How much will overwhelm the Arduino input?
	


!Important!
	Need to do test to see how much will overload the Arduino. If it could be done in a reasonable case, I need to make sure most recent commands are given priority. Really, toss older commands.



Communication needed:
//ideology: Arduino is only the interface for the physical motors and things. It should be doing as little thinking as possible. 

From iPad to Arduino:
 
Left Motor
Right Motor



!Should data from iPad be converted Motor actions in the main Arduino .ino file, or in the Motor class, or is that a good time to actually make use Bluetooth.cpp? Related: can SerialEvent1() live in Bluetooth.cpp?


From Arduino to iPad:






//Not sure if I want to keep it crazy light weight or more of a protocol. 
//ex.

Left		Right
Q=100%		E=100%
A=80%		D=80%
Z=60%		C=60%	//I don't think I can send via Bluetooth quick enough to do a sort PWM with it.
